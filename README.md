statgit2
========

Generate Git development statistics, a reboot of [statgit](https://github.com/soundasleep/statgit).

# Running

```
ruby generate.rb https://github.com/your/repository
```

This will generate, by default, things in `output/` and a database stored locally as `db/database.sqlite3`.
